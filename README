h2. Development Quickstart

h3. Eclipse workspace setup

First, download the target platform and source code from git:

bc. bash> git clone git@github.com:oraclebill/edairy_desktop_lib.git
bash> git clone git@github.com:oraclebill/edairy_desktop.git

Then -
# create an eclipse workspace rooted at 'edairy_desktop'
# set the target platform to 'com.agritrace.edairy.desktop/edairy_manager_desktop.target
# open and run 'com.agritrace.edairy.desktop/edairy_manager_desktop.product'
Application should start and present the static 'home' page.
Click on the 'Milk' tab and see an error - the database is not setup yet.

h3. Database setup

eDairy Manager Desktop is setup to use MySQL database named 'dairytest', located on localhost:3306 with username 'root' and empty password by default.
If you create this database and start the application, it will create the necessary tables automatically on first use.

eDairy Manager Desktop can also use an embedded HSQLDB database. This can be configured through the database configuration file. The database configuration file is located in the application's workspace - the workspace directory is located in the same place as the application executable, or in development mode, in the 'runtime-dairy_manager_desktop.product' directory. In either case the database properties are located in 'riena/ediarydb.properties'. To use hsqldb, the contents of edairydb.properties should look like this :

bc. hibernate.connection.driver_class=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
hibernate.connection.password=
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc\:hsqldb\:file\:devtest.db
hibernate.connection.username=SA
hibernate.current_session_context_class=thread
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update
hibernate.show_sql=true
